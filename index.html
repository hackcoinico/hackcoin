                        <h4 align="center">ARTICLE SEVEN<a name="_Ref480995415"></a>: RISKS</h4>
                        <p>EOS TOKENS MAY HAVE NO VALUE. BUYER MAY LOSE ALL AMOUNTS PAID. Buyer has carefully reviewed, acknowledges, understands and assumes the following risks, as well as all other risks associated with the EOS Tokens (including those not discussed herein), all of which could render the EOS Tokens worthless or of little value:</p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No Rights, Functionality or Features.</span> EOS Tokens have no rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied. EOS Tokens do not entitle holders to participate on the EOS Platform, even if the EOS Platform is launched and the EOS.IO Software&rsquo;s development is finished and the EOS.IO Software is adopted and implemented.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EOS Platform</span>. Buyer should not purchase EOS Tokens in reliance on the EOS Platform because EOS Tokens are not usable on the EOS Platform and do not entitle Buyer to anything with respect to the EOS Platform.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.3.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchase Price Risk</span>. The distribution of EOS Tokens will occur at the end of each set period during the EOS Distribution Period. The purchase price a buyer receives for EOS Tokens depends upon the actions of all other users sending ether (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ETH</span>&rdquo;) to the EOS Token Contract during the same period. Everyone sending ETH during the same period receives the same price. It is possible for other people to send in a large amount of ETH after Buyer and dramatically increase the price Buyer and everyone else pays per EOS Token received. There are no guarantees as to the price of EOS Tokens purchased by Buyer and no guarantees that the price per EOS Token determined each period by the market will be equal to or higher in the subsequent periods of the EOS Distribution Period. There is the possibility that the price per EOS Token in subsequent periods of the EOS Distribution Period falls below the price paid by initial buyers of EOS Tokens during the EOS Distribution Period. block.one reserves the right to change the duration of the EOS Distribution Period for any reason, including, without limitation, bugs in the EOS Distribution Contract or the EOS Token Contract or the unavailability of the Website or other unforeseen procedural or security issues.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blockchain Delay Risk</span>. On the Ethereum blockchain, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random times. For example, ETH contributed to the EOS Smart Contract in the final seconds of a distribution period may not get included for that period. Buyer acknowledges and understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not include the Buyer&rsquo;s transaction at the time Buyer expects and Buyer may not receive EOS Tokens the same day Buyer sends ETH. </strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ethereum Blockchain</span>. The Ethereum blockchain is prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the Ethereum network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. Buyer acknowledges and understands that Ethereum block producers may not include Buyer&rsquo;s transaction when Buyer wants or Buyer&rsquo;s transaction may not be included at all.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ability to Transact or Resell</span>. Buyer may be unable to sell or otherwise transact in EOS Tokens at any time, or for the price Buyer paid. By using the EOS Distribution Contract or the EOS Token Contract or by purchasing EOS Tokens, Buyer acknowledges, understands and agrees that: (a) EOS Tokens may have no value; (b) there is no guarantee or representation of liquidity for the EOS Tokens; and (c) the block.one Parties are not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market value of EOS Tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of EOS Tokens and/or the availability of any market for EOS Tokens through third parties or otherwise.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Token Security</span>. EOS Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the EOS Distribution Contract, the EOS Token Contract or the EOS Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software and EOS Tokens are based on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the EOS Tokens or result in the loss of Buyer&rsquo;s EOS Tokens, the loss of Buyer&rsquo;s ability to access or control Buyer&rsquo;s EOS Tokens or the loss of ETH in Buyer&rsquo;s account. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of EOS Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Access to Private Keys</span>. EOS Tokens purchased by Buyer may be held by Buyer in Buyer&rsquo;s digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with Buyer&rsquo;s digital wallet or vault storing EOS Tokens will result in loss of such EOS Tokens, access to Buyer&rsquo;s EOS Token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service Buyer uses, may be able to misappropriate Buyer&rsquo;s EOS Tokens. Company is not responsible for any such losses.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.9. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EOS Tokens Will Become Non-Transferable</span>. Buyer acknowledges and understands that EOS Tokens will become non-transferrable within twenty-three (23)  hours after the end of the EOS Distribution Period. At this time, Buyer will no longer be able to map a public key to Buyer&rsquo;s account and Buyer will not be able to transfer EOS Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Some cryptocurrency exchanges may on their own accord enable EOS Tokens to continue trading, but the exchanges will be unable to accept new deposits or authorize withdrawals of EOS Tokens.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.10&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Technology</span>. The EOS.IO Software and the EOS Platform and all of the matters set forth in the White Paper are new and untested. The EOS.IO Software might not be capable of completion, implementation or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the EOS.IO Software will be ever be launched and there may never be an operational EOS Platform. Buyer should not rely on the EOS.IO Software or the ability to receive tokens associated with the EOS Platform in the future. Even if the EOS.IO Software is completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any tokens associated with a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO Software may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the EOS Tokens and any tokens transferable on the EOS Platform may become outdated.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.11. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reliance on Third-Parties</span>. Even if completed, the EOS.IO Software will rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet anyone&rsquo;s needs, all of might have a material adverse effect on the EOS.IO Software and EOS Platform.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.12. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Failure to Map a Public Key to Buyer&rsquo;s Account</span>. Failure of Buyer to map a public key to Buyer&rsquo;s account may result in third parties being unable to recognize Buyer&rsquo;s EOS Token balance on the Ethereum blockchain when and if they configure the initial balances of a new blockchain based upon the EOS.IO Software of which Company makes no representation or guarantee. </strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.13. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exchange &amp; Counterparty Risks</span>. If Buyer sends ETH to the EOS Token Contract from an exchange or an account that Buyer does not control, pursuant to the EOS Token Contract, EOS Tokens will be allocated to the account that has sent ETH; therefore, Buyer may never receive or be able to recover Buyer&rsquo;s EOS Tokens. Furthermore, if Buyer chooses to maintain or hold EOS Tokens through a cryptocurrency exchange or other third party, Buyer&rsquo;s EOS Tokens may be stolen or lost. In addition, third parties may not recognize Buyer&rsquo;s claim to any derivative tokens if and when launched by third parties according to the distribution rules set in the EOS.IO Software. By using the EOS Distribution Contract, using the EOS Token Contract and/or by purchasing EOS Tokens, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer sends ETH to the EOS Token Contract through an exchange account and/or holds EOS Tokens on a cryptocurrency exchange or with another third party at Buyer&rsquo;s own and sole risk.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.14&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to the EOS.IO Software</span>. The EOS.IO Software is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although Company intends for the EOS.IO Software to have the features and specifications set forth in the White Paper, Company may make changes to such features and specifications for any number of reasons, and any party that adopts the EOS.IO Software and launches the EOS Platform also may make changes, any of which may mean that the EOS Platform does not meet Buyer&rsquo;s expectations.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.15&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Alternative Blockchains based on EOS.IO Software</span>. The EOS.IO Software will not likely be licensed under an open source license until after the end of the EOS Distribution Period; however, it is possible somebody will not respect the EOS.IO Software copyright or will modify the EOS.IO Software after it has been released under an open source license. Therefore, it is possible for someone to utilize the EOS.IO Software to build and launch blockchain protocols using a token distribution other than the one intended for the EOS Tokens pursuant to the EOS.IO Software both prior to or after the EOS.IO Software has become licensed as open source.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.16&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Lack of Transferability in Blockchain Cryptographic Token</span>. The EOS.IO Software is built such that any blockchain that adopts the EOS.IO Software will require approval of holders of not less than 15% of the total issued and outstanding EOS Tokens before tokens on such blockchain (the "<u>Blockchain Tokens</u>&rdquo;) can be transferred. In other words, if the EOS.IO Software is adopted, it will be the responsibility of holders holding at least 15% of the issued and outstanding EOS Tokens to adopt one or more blockchains in order for Blockchain Tokens received on such blockchains to be transferrable. Buyer acknowledges, understands and agrees that if the EOS.IO Software is adopted and the requisite vote described above is not obtained, Buyer may not be able to transfer any Blockchain Tokens Buyer receives.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.17. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Completion</span>. The development of the EOS.IO Software may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects, or departure of key personnel.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.18. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lack of Interest</span>. Even if the EOS.IO Software is finished and adopted and the EOS Platform is launched, the ongoing success of the EOS Platform relies on the interest and participation of third parties like developers. There can be no assurance or guarantee that there will be sufficient interest or participation in the EOS Platform.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.19.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Uncertain Regulatory Framework</span>. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact EOS Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that EOS Tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration. Company may cease the distribution of EOS Tokens, the development of the EOS.IO Software or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.</strong></p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>7.20. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Government Action</span>. As noted above, the industry in which Company operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of Company and/or pursue enforcement actions against Company. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Company in particular. All of this may subject Company to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Company to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm Company&rsquo;s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the EOS Tokens and/or the development of the EOS.IO Software.</strong></p>
